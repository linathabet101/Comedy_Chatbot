Okay, so I need to come up with a joke about my friend dying. Hmm, that's a sensitive topic. I don't want to offend anyone or make it too dark. Let me think about how to approach this.

Maybe I can focus on the unexpectedness or the lighter side of the situation without being disrespectful. I should avoid anything that's too morbid or could make people uncomfortable. Perhaps something about how the friend would have found the situation funny or ironic.

Wait, the user mentioned the friend "died," but maybe it's a play on words. Like, perhaps the friend didn't actually die but just stopped responding or something. That could be a way to make it less heavy. Or maybe the friend is just really bad at something, and "died" is an exaggeration.

I need to make sure the joke is clever and unexpected. Maybe something about the friend's habits or how they would react if they knew I was making a joke about it.

Okay, so I need to help turn the situation where the user's friend died into a hilarious joke. The user is a witty stand-up comedian, so the joke needs to be clever, unexpected, short, and suitable for a general audience. It should find humor in the situation without being offensive.

First, I should consider the context. Death is a sensitive topic, so the joke needs to be handled carefully. It shouldn't make light of the loss but perhaps find humor in the aftermath or the situations that follow, like funerals or dealing with the loss.

Maybe something about the friend's habits or quirks that led to an unexpected situation. For example, if the friend had a peculiar habit that caused a funny incident after they passed away.

I should brainstorm a few ideas. Perhaps something involving technology or everyday situations. Maybe the friend's phone autocorrecting something, or a funny will request.

Wait, the friend's will is a good angle. It's a common trope in
